# 🔄 Story 3.3 — Adjust Assumptions

## Purpose (Plain English)

This story lets users ask:
> "How sensitive is my retirement plan to the future not going exactly as expected?"

It gives users safe control knobs to explore outcomes without changing their real financial profile.

## What "Assumptions" Mean (Definition)

Assumptions are model-level parameters applied on top of the user's financial facts.

They are:
- Hypothetical
- Reversible
- Non-destructive
- Global to the projection

### Examples
- Expected annual return (e.g., 5% → 4%)
- Inflation rate (e.g., 3% → 5%)
- Retirement age (60 → 62)
- Contribution growth or reduction

## What This Story Covers

### User Capability
- View current assumptions
- Modify assumptions via simple controls
- Instantly see updated projections
- Revert to defaults

### System Capability
- Re-run projection deterministically
- Track assumption changes separately from core inputs
- Provide deltas for AI explanation

## What This Story Does NOT Cover

🚫 It does NOT:
- Edit core financial data (assets, income, debts)
- Save permanent profile changes (unless explicitly confirmed)
- Create named scenarios (that's Epic 3)
- Run probabilistic simulations

## User-Facing Behavior

### UI Pattern (Recommended)
- "Assumptions" panel or drawer
- Slider / input controls with guardrails
- "Reset to Default" button

**Example:**
```
Expected return: 5.0%
Inflation: 3.0%
Retirement age: 60
```

## Acceptance Criteria (Detailed)

### Display
- Current assumptions are visible and clearly labeled
- Default assumptions are visually distinct (e.g., "Recommended")

### Editing
User can adjust:
- Expected annual return (range: 1%–10%)
- Inflation rate (range: 1%–8%)
- Retirement age (must be > current age)
- Changes apply immediately (no save button required)

### Recompute
- Projection re-runs automatically after any change
- Updated results appear within ≤2 seconds
- Chart and summary update consistently

### State Management
Assumptions are stored separately from:
- Financial profile
- Saved plan inputs
- Leaving the page resets assumptions unless user explicitly saves

## Engineering Model (Clean Separation)

```
Financial Profile  →  Assumptions  →  Projection  →  Results
      (facts)          (knobs)        (math)        (UI + AI)
```

This separation prevents:
- Accidental overwrites
- Confusion between "what I have" and "what might happen"

## AI Integration (Why This Story Matters)

The AI narrative depends heavily on assumption changes.

**Example:**
> "If returns average 4% instead of 5%, your savings may run out 6 years earlier. Delaying retirement by two years offsets most of that risk."

That requires:
- Baseline assumptions
- Modified assumptions
- Projection delta

## Emotional Design Principle

Assumptions should feel empowering, not risky.

**Good UX:**
- "Try a more conservative return"
- "See what happens if inflation is higher"

**Bad UX:**
- "Change your expected return (this affects your plan)"
