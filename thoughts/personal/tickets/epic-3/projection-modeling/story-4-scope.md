# Story 3.4 — Support Multiple Income & Expense Streams

As a user, I want the projection to account for different income and expense sources so the model reflects real life.

## Acceptance Criteria

- System supports:
  - Multiple income sources (e.g., Social Security, rental income)
  - A primary retirement spending target
- Income sources can start at different ages.
- Spending inflates annually after retirement.
- Projection correctly combines:
  - Asset growth
  - Income inflows
  - Expense outflows
