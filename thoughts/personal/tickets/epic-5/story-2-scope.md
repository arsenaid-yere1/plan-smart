# Story 5.2: Delta-Based Explanation (No Absolute Rewrites)

As a user, I want to understand what changed and why.

## Built-in Guardrails

- AI receives base + scenario projection
- Must compute deltas, not rewrite full plan

## Acceptance

Output explicitly references:

- "Compared to your base plan…"
- Quantified deltas only
- Base plan remains untouched
