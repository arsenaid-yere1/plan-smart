## Epic Context

**Epic 7: Tax-Relevant Profile & Income Context Modeling**

### Epic Goal

Enable users to express how they make money, how flexible it is, and how taxes affect their choices, so PlanSmart can deliver explicit, goal-driven tax optimization guidance instead of implicit assumptions.

This epic establishes tax awareness as a first-class planning input, not a derived afterthought.

### Epic Success Criteria

- Users can describe income in human terms, not tax forms
- Tax treatment differences are explicitly modeled
- Early-retirement and tax-optimization intent is user-stated
- Downstream projections reference declared tax goals, not guessed behavior
